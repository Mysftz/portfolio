To further explore artificial intelligent systems within society, a cognitive neural network model that detect a disease in the cassava plant is taken and improved. Initial issues arise in the modelâ€™s runtime and GPU requirement allowing only a small number of epochs to happen, where theoretically, the more epoch the better the test accuracy. Outsourcing the GPU via a python web server on Google Col- lab and the runtime issue resolved , it was found that the system could have the potentially to improve the test accuracy up 67% given certain criteria met through training layer independently from each other. Through testing, it was proven that the more epoch ran, the better the test accuracy however the limit was beyond the GPU restrictions but could be seen in further development. The hindrances did not allow for the projects goals to be completed however sufficient improvement was made unto the existing model and is set for further development.
